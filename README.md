In this simple project i'm just trying to figure out some things including
1. React Router
2. Redux
3. Context
4. Css Modules 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To get the code, clone the repo <br>
```
git clone https://github.com/majiyd/React-Router-Redux-Context.git
```
then run  
```
npm install
```
and
```
npm start
```
this runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
